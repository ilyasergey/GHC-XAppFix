-- Extract from a list of type constructors those (1) which need to be vectorised and (2) those

--
-- A type constructor will only be vectorised if it is
--
-- (1) a data type constructor, with vanilla data constructors (i.e., data constructors admitted by
--     Haskell 98) and
-- (2) at least one of the type constructors that appears in its definition is also vectorised.
--
-- If (1) is met, but not (2), the type constructor may appear in vectorised code, but there is no
-- need to vectorise that type constructor itself.  This holds, for example, for all enumeration
-- types.  As '([::])' is being vectorised, any type constructor whose definition involves
-- '([::])', either directly or indirectly, will be vectorised.

-- |From a list of type constructors, extract those that can be vectorised, returning them in two
-- sets, where the first result list /must be/ vectorised and the second result list /need not be/
-- vectorised.  The third result list are those type constructors that we cannot convert (either
-- because they use language extensions or because they dependent on type constructors for which
-- no vectorised version is available).

-- The first argument determines the /conversion status/ of external type constructors as follows:
--
-- * tycons which have converted versions are mapped to 'True'
-- * tycons which are not changed by vectorisation are mapped to 'False'
-- * tycons which can't be converted are not elements of the map
