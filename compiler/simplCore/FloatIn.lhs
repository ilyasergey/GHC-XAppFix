%************************************************************************

The main purpose of @floatInwards@ is floating into branches of a
case, so that we don't allocate things, save them on the stack, and
then discover that they aren't needed in the chosen branch.

\begin{code}
{-# OPTIONS -fno-warn-tabs #-}
-- The above warning supression flag is a temporary kludge.
-- While working on this module you are encouraged to remove it and
-- detab the module (please do the detabbing in a separate patch). See

module FloatIn ( floatInwards ) where

Top-level interface function, @floatInwards@.  Note that we do not
actually float any bindings downwards from the top-level.

\begin{code}
floatInwards :: CoreProgram -> CoreProgram
floatInwards = map fi_top_bind
  where
    fi_top_bind (NonRec binder rhs)
      = NonRec binder (fiExpr [] (freeVars rhs))
    fi_top_bind (Rec pairs)
      = Rec [ (b, fiExpr [] (freeVars rhs)) | (b, rhs) <- pairs ]
\end{code}

{\em Will wrote: What??? I thought the idea was to float as far
inwards as possible, no matter what.  This is dropping all bindings
every time it sees a lambda of any kind.  Help! }

You are assuming we DO DO full laziness AFTER floating inwards!  We
have to [not float inside lambdas] if we don't.

If we indeed do full laziness after the floating inwards (we could
check the compilation flags for that) then I agree we could be more
aggressive and do float inwards past lambdas.

Actually we are not doing a proper full laziness (see below), which
was another reason for not floating inwards past a lambda.

This can easily be fixed.  The problem is that we float lets outwards,
but there are a few expressions which are not let bound, like case
scrutinees and case alternatives.  After floating inwards the
simplifier could decide to inline the let and the laziness would be
lost, e.g.

\begin{verbatim}
let a = expensive             ==> \b -> case expensive of ...
in \ b -> case a of ...
\end{verbatim}
The fix is
\begin{enumerate}
\item
to let bind the algebraic case scrutinees (done, I think) and
the case alternatives (except the ones with an
unboxed type)(not done, I think). This is best done in the
SetLevels.lhs module, which tags things with their level numbers.
\item
do the full laziness pass (floating lets outwards).
\item
simplify. The simplifier inlines the (trivial) lets that were
 created but were not floated outwards.
\end{enumerate}

With the fix I think Will's suggestion that we can gain even more from
strictness by floating inwards past lambdas makes sense.

We still gain even without going past lambdas, as things may be
strict in the (new) context of a branch (where it was floated to) or
of a let rhs, e.g.
\begin{verbatim}
let a = something            case x of
in case x of                   alt1 -> case something of a -> a + a
     alt1 -> a + a      ==>    alt2 -> b
     alt2 -> b

let a = something           let b = case something of a -> a + a
in let b = a + a        ==> in (b,b)
in (b,b)
\end{verbatim}
Also, even if a is not found to be strict in the new context and is
still left as a let, if the branch is not taken (or b is not entered)
the closure for a is not built.

\begin{code}
type FreeVarSet  = IdSet
type BoundVarSet = IdSet

data FloatInBind = FB BoundVarSet FreeVarSet FloatBind
	-- The FreeVarSet is the free variables of the binding.  In the case
	-- of recursive bindings, the set doesn't include the bound
	-- variables.

type FloatInBinds = [FloatInBind]
	-- In reverse dependency order (innermost binder first)

fiExpr :: FloatInBinds		-- Binds we're trying to drop
				-- as far "inwards" as possible
       -> CoreExprWithFVs	-- Input expr
       -> CoreExpr		-- Result

fiExpr to_drop (_, AnnLit lit)     = ASSERT( null to_drop ) Lit lit
fiExpr to_drop (_, AnnType ty)     = ASSERT( null to_drop ) Type ty
fiExpr to_drop (_, AnnVar v)       = wrapFloats to_drop (Var v)
fiExpr to_drop (_, AnnCoercion co) = wrapFloats to_drop (Coercion co)
fiExpr to_drop (_, AnnCast expr (fvs_co, co))
  = wrapFloats (drop_here ++ co_drop) $
    Cast (fiExpr e_drop expr) co
  where
    [drop_here, e_drop, co_drop] = sepBindsByDropPoint False [freeVarsOf expr, fvs_co] to_drop
\end{code}

Applications: we do float inside applications, mainly because we
need to get at all the arguments.  The next simplifier run will
pull out any silly ones.

\begin{code}
fiExpr to_drop (_,AnnApp fun arg@(arg_fvs, ann_arg))
  | noFloatIntoRhs ann_arg  = wrapFloats drop_here $ wrapFloats arg_drop $
                              App (fiExpr fun_drop fun) (fiExpr [] arg)
       -- It's inconvenient to test for an unlifted arg here,
       -- and it really doesn't matter if we float into one
  | otherwise               = wrapFloats drop_here $
                              App (fiExpr fun_drop fun) (fiExpr arg_drop arg)
  where
    [drop_here, fun_drop, arg_drop] 
      = sepBindsByDropPoint False [freeVarsOf fun, arg_fvs] to_drop
\end{code}

Note [Floating in past a lambda group]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* We must be careful about floating inside inside a value lambda.  
  That risks losing laziness.
  The float-out pass might rescue us, but then again it might not.

* We must be careful about type lambdas too.  At one time we did, and
  there is no risk of duplicating work thereby, but we do need to be
  careful.  In particular, here is a bad case (it happened in the
  cichelli benchmark:
   	let v = ...
   	in let f = /\t -> \a -> ...
   	   ==>
   	let f = /\t -> let v = ... in \a -> ...
  This is bad as now f is an updatable closure (update PAP)
  and has arity 0.

* Hack alert!  We only float in through one-shot lambdas, 
  not (as you might guess) through lone big lambdas.  
  Reason: we float *out* past big lambdas (see the test in the Lam
  case of FloatOut.floatExpr) and we don't want to float straight
  back in again.
  
  It *is* important to float into one-shot lambdas, however;
  see the remarks with noFloatIntoRhs.

So we treat lambda in groups, using the following rule:

 Float in if (a) there is at least one Id, 
         and (b) there are no non-one-shot Ids

 Otherwise drop all the bindings outside the group.

This is what the 'go' function in the AnnLam case is doing.

Urk! if all are tyvars, and we don't float in, we may miss an 
      opportunity to float inside a nested case branch

\begin{code}
fiExpr to_drop lam@(_, AnnLam _ _)
  | go False bndrs 	-- Float in
  = mkLams bndrs (fiExpr to_drop body)

  | otherwise	 	-- Dump it all here
  = wrapFloats to_drop (mkLams bndrs (fiExpr [] body))

  where
    (bndrs, body) = collectAnnBndrs lam

    go seen_one_shot_id [] = seen_one_shot_id
    go seen_one_shot_id (b:bs)
      | isTyVar       b = go seen_one_shot_id bs
      | isOneShotBndr b = go True bs
      | otherwise       = False	 -- Give up at a non-one-shot Id
\end{code}

We don't float lets inwards past an SCC.
	ToDo: keep info on current cc, and when passing
	one, if it is not the same, annotate all lets in binds with current
	cc, change current cc to the new one and float binds into expr.

\begin{code}
fiExpr to_drop (_, AnnTick tickish expr)
  | tickishScoped tickish
  =     -- Wimp out for now - we could push values in
    wrapFloats to_drop (Tick tickish (fiExpr [] expr))

  | otherwise
  = Tick tickish (fiExpr to_drop expr)
\end{code}

For @Lets@, the possible ``drop points'' for the \tr{to_drop}
bindings are: (a)~in the body, (b1)~in the RHS of a NonRec binding,
or~(b2), in each of the RHSs of the pairs of a @Rec@.

Note that we do {\em weird things} with this let's binding.  Consider:
\begin{verbatim}
let
    w = ...
in {
    let v = ... w ...
    in ... v .. w ...
}
\end{verbatim}
Look at the inner \tr{let}.  As \tr{w} is used in both the bind and
body of the inner let, we could panic and leave \tr{w}'s binding where
it is.  But \tr{v} is floatable further into the body of the inner let, and
{\em then} \tr{w} will also be only in the body of that inner let.

So: rather than drop \tr{w}'s binding here, we add it onto the list of
things to drop in the outer let's body, and let nature take its
course.

Note [extra_fvs (1): avoid floating into RHS]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consdider let x=\y....t... in body.  We do not necessarily want to float 
a binding for t into the RHS, because it'll immediately be floated out
again.  (It won't go inside the lambda else we risk losing work.)
In letrec, we need to be more careful still. We don't want to transform
	let x# = y# +# 1#
	in
	letrec f = \z. ...x#...f...
	in ...
into
	letrec f = let x# = y# +# 1# in \z. ...x#...f... in ...
because now we can't float the let out again, because a letrec
can't have unboxed bindings.

So we make "extra_fvs" which is the rhs_fvs of such bindings, and
arrange to dump bindings that bind extra_fvs before the entire let.

Note [extra_fvs (2): free variables of rules]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider 
  let x{rule mentioning y} = rhs in body 
Here y is not free in rhs or body; but we still want to dump bindings
that bind y outside the let.  So we augment extra_fvs with the
idRuleAndUnfoldingVars of x.  No need for type variables, hence not using
idFreeVars.

bindings are: (a)~inside the scrutinee, (b)~inside one of the

%************************************************************************

This is the crucial function.  The idea is: We have a wad of bindings
that we'd like to distribute inside a collection of {\em drop points};
insides the alternatives of a \tr{case} would be one example of some
drop points; the RHS and body of a non-recursive \tr{let} binding
would be another (2-element) collection.

So: We're given a list of sets-of-free-variables, one per drop point,
and a list of floating-inwards bindings.  If a binding can go into
only one drop point (without suddenly making something out-of-scope),
in it goes.  If a binding is used inside {\em multiple} drop points,
then it has to go in a you-must-drop-it-above-all-these-drop-points
point.

We have to maintain the order on these drop-point-related lists.

    -> [FloatInBinds]      -- FIRST one is bindings which must not be floated
			    -- inside any drop point; the rest correspond
			    -- one-to-one with the input list of FV sets

-- Every input floater is returned somewhere in the result;
-- none are dropped, not even ones which don't seem to be
-- free in *any* of the drop-point fvs.  Why?  Because, for example,
-- a binding (let x = E in B) might have a specialised version of
-- x (say x') stored inside x, but x' isn't free in E or B.
