Note [Overlap and deriving]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider some overlapping instances:
  data Show a => Show [a] where ..
  data Show [Char] where ...

Now a data type with deriving:
  data T a = MkT [a] deriving( Show )

We want to get the derived instance
  instance Show [a] => Show (T a) where...
and NOT
  instance Show a => Show (T a) where...
so that the (Show (T Char)) instance does the Right Thing

It's very like the situation when we're inferring the type
of a function
   f x = show [x]
and we want to infer
   f :: Show [a] => a -> String

BOTTOM LINE: use vanilla, non-overlappable skolems when inferring
             the context for the derived instance. 
	     Hence tcInstSkolTyVars not tcInstSuperSkolTyVars

Note [Exotic derived instance contexts]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In a 'derived' instance declaration, we *infer* the context.  It's a
bit unclear what rules we should apply for this; the Haskell report is
silent.  Obviously, constraints like (Eq a) are fine, but what about
	data T f a = MkT (f a) deriving( Eq )
where we'd get an Eq (f a) constraint.  That's probably fine too.

One could go further: consider
	data T a b c = MkT (Foo a b c) deriving( Eq )
	instance (C Int a, Eq b, Eq c) => Eq (Foo a b c)

Notice that this instance (just) satisfies the Paterson termination 
conditions.  Then we *could* derive an instance decl like this:

	instance (C Int a, Eq b, Eq c) => Eq (T a b c) 
even though there is no instance for (C Int a), because there just
*might* be an instance for, say, (C Int Bool) at a site where we
need the equality instance for T's.  

However, this seems pretty exotic, and it's quite tricky to allow
this, and yet give sensible error messages in the (much more common)
case where we really want that instance decl for C.

So for now we simply require that the derived instance context
should have only type-variable constraints.

Here is another example:
	data Fix f = In (f (Fix f)) deriving( Eq )
Here, if we are prepared to allow -XUndecidableInstances we
could derive the instance
	instance Eq (f (Fix f)) => Eq (Fix f)
but this is so delicate that I don't think it should happen inside
'deriving'. If you want this, write it yourself!

NB: if you want to lift this condition, make sure you still meet the
termination conditions!  If not, the deriving mechanism generates
larger and larger constraints.  Example:
  data Succ a = S a
  data Seq a = Cons a (Seq (Succ a)) | Nil deriving Show

Note the lack of a Show instance for Succ.  First we'll generate
  instance (Show (Succ a), Show a) => Show (Seq a)
and then
  instance (Show (Succ (Succ a)), Show (Succ a), Show a) => Show (Seq a)
and so on.  Instead we want to complain of no instance for (Show (Succ a)).

The bottom line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Allow constraints which consist only of type variables, with no repeats.

Note [Which variables to quantify]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose the inferred type of a function is
   T kappa (alpha:kappa) -> Int
where alpha is a type unification variable and 
      kappa is a kind unification variable
Then we want to quantify over *both* alpha and kappa.  But notice that
kappa appears "at top level" of the type, as well as inside the kind
of alpha.  So it should be fine to just look for the "top level"
kind/type variables of the type, without looking transitively into the
kinds of those type variables.

Note [Minimize by Superclasses]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

When we quantify over a constraint, in simplifyInfer we need to
quantify over a constraint that is minimal in some sense: For
instance, if the final wanted constraint is (Eq alpha, Ord alpha),
we'd like to quantify over Ord alpha, because we can just get Eq alpha
from superclass selection from Ord alpha. This minimization is what
mkMinimalBySCs does. Then, simplifyInfer uses the minimal constraint
to check the original wanted.

Note [Avoid unecessary constraint simplification]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When inferring the type of a let-binding, with simplifyInfer,
try to avoid unnecessariliy simplifying class constraints.
Doing so aids sharing, but it also helps with delicate 
situations like
   instance C t => C [t] where ..
   f :: C [t] => ....
   f x = let g y = ...(constraint C [t])... 
         in ...
When inferring a type for 'g', we don't want to apply the
instance decl, because then we can't satisfy (C t).  So we
just notice that g isn't quantified over 't' and partition
the contraints before simplifying.

This only half-works, but then let-generalisation only half-works.


Note [Inheriting implicit parameters]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider this:

	f x = (x::Int) + ?y

where f is *not* a top-level binding.
From the RHS of f we'll get the constraint (?y::Int).
There are two types we might infer for f:

	f :: Int -> Int

(so we get ?y from the context of f's definition), or

	f :: (?y::Int) => Int -> Int

At first you might think the first was better, becuase then
?y behaves like a free variable of the definition, rather than
having to be passed at each call site.  But of course, the WHOLE
IDEA is that ?y should be passed at each call site (that's what
dynamic binding means) so we'd better infer the second.

BOTTOM LINE: when *inferring types* you *must* quantify 
over implicit parameters. See the predicate isFreeWhenInferring.

Note [Simplifying RULE lhs constraints]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On the LHS of transformation rules we only simplify only equalities,
but not dictionaries.  We want to keep dictionaries unsimplified, to
serve as the available stuff for the RHS of the rule.  We *do* want to
simplify equalities, however, to detect ill-typed rules that cannot be
applied.

Implementation: the TcSFlags carried by the TcSMonad controls the
amount of simplification, so simplifyRuleLhs just sets the flag
appropriately.

Example.  Consider the following left-hand side of a rule
	f (x == y) (y > z) = ...
If we typecheck this expression we get constraints
	d1 :: Ord a, d2 :: Eq a
We do NOT want to "simplify" to the LHS
	forall x::a, y::a, z::a, d1::Ord a.
	  f ((==) (eqFromOrd d1) x y) ((>) d1 y z) = ...
Instead we want	
	forall x::a, y::a, z::a, d1::Ord a, d2::Eq a.
	  f ((==) d2 x y) ((>) d1 y z) = ...

Here is another example:
	fromIntegral :: (Integral a, Num b) => a -> b
	{-# RULES "foo"  fromIntegral = id :: Int -> Int #-}
In the rule, a=b=Int, and Num Int is a superclass of Integral Int. But
we *dont* want to get
	forall dIntegralInt.
	   fromIntegral Int Int dIntegralInt (scsel dIntegralInt) = id Int
because the scsel will mess up RULE matching.  Instead we want
	forall dIntegralInt, dNumInt.
	  fromIntegral Int Int dIntegralInt dNumInt = id Int

Even if we have 
	g (x == y) (y == z) = ..
where the two dictionaries are *identical*, we do NOT WANT
	forall x::a, y::a, z::a, d1::Eq a
	  f ((==) d1 x y) ((>) d1 y z) = ...
because that will only match if the dict args are (visibly) equal.
Instead we want to quantify over the dictionaries separately.

In short, simplifyRuleLhs must *only* squash equalities, leaving
all dicts unchanged, with absolutely no sharing.  

HOWEVER, under a nested implication things are different
Consider
  f :: (forall a. Eq a => a->a) -> Bool -> ...
  {-# RULES "foo" forall (v::forall b. Eq b => b->b).
       f b True = ...
    #=}
Here we *must* solve the wanted (Eq a) from the given (Eq a)
resulting from skolemising the agument type of g.  So we 
revert to SimplCheck when going under an implication.

Note [Preparing inert set for implications]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before solving the nested implications, we convert any unsolved flat wanteds
to givens, and add them to the inert set.  Reasons:

  a) In checking mode, suppresses unnecessary errors.  We already have
     on unsolved-wanted error; adding it to the givens prevents any 
     consequential errors from showing up

  b) More importantly, in inference mode, we are going to quantify over this
     constraint, and we *don't* want to quantify over any constraints that
     are deducible from it.

  c) Flattened type-family equalities must be exposed to the nested
     constraints.  Consider
	F b ~ alpha, (forall c.  F b ~ alpha)
     Obviously this is soluble with [alpha := F b].  But the
     unification is only done by solveCTyFunEqs, right at the end of
     solveWanteds, and if we aren't careful we'll end up with an
     unsolved goal inside the implication.  We need to "push" the
     as-yes-unsolved (F b ~ alpha) inwards, as a *given*, so that it
     can be used to solve the inner (F b
     ~ alpha).  See Trac #4935.

  d) There are other cases where interactions between wanteds that can help
     to solve a constraint. For example

  	class C a b | a -> b

  	(C Int alpha), (forall d. C d blah => C Int a)

     If we push the (C Int alpha) inwards, as a given, it can produce
     a fundep (alpha~a) and this can float out again and be used to
     fix alpha.  (In general we can't float class constraints out just
     in case (C d blah) might help to solve (C Int a).)

The unsolved wanteds are *canonical* but they may not be *inert*,
because when made into a given they might interact with other givens.
Hence the call to solveInteract.  Example:

 Original inert set = (d :_g D a) /\ (co :_w  a ~ [beta]) 

We were not able to solve (a ~w [beta]) but we can't just assume it as
given because the resulting set is not inert. Hence we have to do a
'solveInteract' step first. 

Finally, note that we convert them to [Given] and NOT [Given/Solved].
The reason is that Given/Solved are weaker than Givens and may be discarded.
As an example consider the inference case, where we may have, the following 
original constraints: 
     [Wanted] F Int ~ Int
             (F Int ~ a => F Int ~ a)
If we convert F Int ~ Int to [Given/Solved] instead of Given, then the next 
given (F Int ~ a) is going to cause the Given/Solved to be ignored, casting 
the (F Int ~ a) insoluble. Hence we should really convert the residual 
wanteds to plain old Given. 

We need only push in unsolved equalities both in checking mode and inference mode: 

  (1) In checking mode we should not push given dictionaries in because of
example LongWayOverlapping.hs, where we might get strange overlap
errors between far-away constraints in the program.  But even in
checking mode, we must still push type family equations. Consider:

   type instance F True a b = a 
   type instance F False a b = b

   [w] F c a b ~ gamma 
   (c ~ True) => a ~ gamma 
   (c ~ False) => b ~ gamma

Since solveCTyFunEqs happens at the very end of solving, the only way to solve
the two implications is temporarily consider (F c a b ~ gamma) as Given (NB: not 
merely Given/Solved because it has to interact with the top-level instance 
environment) and push it inside the implications. Now, when we come out again at
the end, having solved the implications solveCTyFunEqs will solve this equality.

  (2) In inference mode, we recheck the final constraint in checking mode and
hence we will be able to solve inner implications from top-level quantified
constraints nonetheless.


Note [Extra TcsTv untouchables]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Furthemore, we record the inert set simplifier-generated unification
variables of the TcsTv kind (such as variables from instance that have
been applied, or unification flattens). These variables must be passed
to the implications as extra untouchable variables. Otherwise we have
the danger of double unifications. Example (from trac ticket #4494):

   (F Int ~ uf)  /\  (forall a. C a => F Int ~ beta) 

In this example, beta is touchable inside the implication. The first
solveInteract step leaves 'uf' ununified. Then we move inside the
implication where a new constraint
       uf  ~  beta  
emerges. We may spontaneously solve it to get uf := beta, so the whole
implication disappears but when we pop out again we are left with (F
Int ~ uf) which will be unified by our final solveCTyFunEqs stage and
uf will get unified *once more* to (F Int).

The solution is to record the TcsTvs (i.e. the simplifier-generated
unification variables) that are generated when solving the flats, and
make them untouchables for the nested implication. In the example
above uf would become untouchable, so beta would be forced to be
unified as beta := uf.

NB: A consequence is that every simplifier-generated TcsTv variable
    that gets floated out of an implication becomes now untouchable
    next time we go inside that implication to solve any residual
    constraints. In effect, by floating an equality out of the
    implication we are committing to have it solved in the outside.

Note [Solving Family Equations] 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
After we are done with simplification we may be left with constraints of the form:
     [Wanted] F xis ~ beta 
If 'beta' is a touchable unification variable not already bound in the TyBinds 
then we'd like to create a binding for it, effectively "defaulting" it to be 'F xis'.

When is it ok to do so? 
    1) 'beta' must not already be defaulted to something. Example: 

           [Wanted] F Int  ~ beta   <~ Will default [beta := F Int]
           [Wanted] F Char ~ beta   <~ Already defaulted, can't default again. We 
                                       have to report this as unsolved.

    2) However, we must still do an occurs check when defaulting (F xis ~ beta), to 
       set [beta := F xis] only if beta is not among the free variables of xis.

    3) Notice that 'beta' can't be bound in ty binds already because we rewrite RHS 
       of type family equations. See Inert Set invariants in TcInteract.

        1) Make up new TcEvBinds
        2) Extend TcS with (groupVariable 
        3) given_inert <- solveOne inert (given : a ~ tau) 
        4) (final_inert,unsolved) <- solveWanted (given_inert) (group_constraints)

                 sneakyUnify a |-> tau 
                 write the evidence bins
                 return (final_inert ++ group_constraints,[])

Note [tryTcS in defaulting]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

defaultTyVar and disambigGroup create new evidence variables for
default equations, and hence update the EvVar cache. However, after
applyDefaultingRules we will try to solve these default equations
using solveInteractCts, which will consult the cache and solve those
EvVars from themselves! That's wrong.

To avoid this problem we guard defaulting under a @tryTcS@ which leaves
the original cache unmodified.

There is a second reason for @tryTcS@ in defaulting: disambGroup does
some constraint solving to determine if a default equation is
``useful'' in solving some wanted constraints, but we want to
discharge all evidence and unifications that may have happened during
this constraint solving.

Finally, @tryTcS@ importantly does not inherit the original cache from
the higher level but makes up a new cache, the reason is that disambigGroup
will call solveInteractCts so the new derived and the wanteds must not be 
in the cache!

Note [Avoiding spurious errors]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When doing the unification for defaulting, we check for skolem
type variables, and simply don't default them.  For example:
   f = (*)	-- Monomorphic
   g :: Num a => a -> a
   g x = f x x
Here, we get a complaint when checking the type signature for g,
that g isn't polymorphic enough; but then we get another one when
dealing with the (Num a) context arising from f's definition;
we try to unify a with Int (to default it), but find that it's
already been unified with the rigid variable from g's type sig
